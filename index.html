					<h2>What we can do for you</h2>
					<p>
						When you apply for a personal loan or short-term loan through First Choices Personal Loans you get instant access to hundreds of lenders across the country looking to fund loans from all types of borrowers. We work with direct lenders who approve loans for large dollar amounts all the way down to those lending a few hundred bucks. We can also accomodate all credit types and you'll never have to worry about any inquiries affecting your fico score. Even if you've been labeled poor credit or bad credit in the past you may still qualify for a loan product. At the end of the day we just want to make sure you're placed with the proper loan solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our loan matching service is always 100% free and we don't work with any lenders that charge upfront for loans. If you are ever asked to pay upfront for a loan walk away. By submitting an application on our site you are never bound to any loan offer until you have accepted the lenders terms and conditions. We do our best to disclose all important concepts to our customers so if you are ever presented with anything that seems questionable please make sure to notify us so we can take the proper steps to correct it. We work hard to ensure our customers are satisfied and want your experience here to be a great one!
					</p>
					<p>
						First Choice Personal loans also takes security and your privacy very seriously. While we do ask for some sensitive information, to allow our lenders to make proper decisions when deciding whether or not to fund a loan, all sensitive information is encrypted and never stored. So once your session is over your sensitive info is erased from our database.

					<h2>How does First Choice Personal Loans work?</h2>
					<p>
						To put it simply: First Choice is a matching service and not a lender. We go to extensive lengths to match you with the best lender to fund your loan. While we work directly with some lenders, we also work with lending networks very similar to ours. These lending networks all contain their own portfolio of direct lenders and lending networks. By doing this we give you the greatest chance of getting approved because not only will your application hit qualified lenders in our network but it will also give you the ability to reach a lender in another network who might be willing to fund your loan. Once you apply we filter your application through criteria from all our lenders and then the matching process begins. All applications are processed in real-time so once you hit the submit button your application is presented to our network of lenders one by one to try and find a lender that matches your request. Most process times take between 2-5 minutes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon a successful match you will be redirected to the lenders loan agreement where you will receive your loan offer. Here you will find the identity of the creditor, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule and your total number of payments. Lender terms vary so make sure to read your offer thoroughly to ensure you understand all the key elements of the lending agreement before accepting the lenders offer. Usually the typical APR range is anywhere from 6.59% up to 39.99% APR for most personal loan products offered through the lending partners on this site. Generally, the typical representative APR range is somewhere between 261% and 1404% for a short term loan that is intended for 14 days. If you agree to the lenders terms you may be contacted to verify important information so your money can be deposited directly into your bank account. The amount of time it takes to receive your funds will also vary depending on your lender and how quickly your loan can be approved based on the information you provided them. However, most loans will be funded with 1-5 business day.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any questions or concerns about how our service works please feel free to email us or give us a call and let us know what we can do to help you. We appreciate your business and look forward to being your First Choice when it comes to personal or short-term loans.

Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of your loan. Ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for non-payment. If you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: CHARGE YOU LATE FEES, SEND YOUR ACCOUNT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY, REPORT YOUR INFORMATION TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE OR MAY OFFER TO RENEW, EXTEND OR REFINANCE YOUR LOAN WHICH MAY CAUSE YOU TO INCURE ADDITIONAL FEES, CHARGES AND INTEREST.
				</p>
				<p>
				Actual loan amounts, terms and interest rates may vary by state and by lender. This website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. This website simply matches you with an appropriate lender or lending network based on your application. Cash transfer times may vary between lenders and in some circumstances faxing is required. Typically lenders will NOT perform credit checks with the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, TransUnion. However, credit checks or consumer reports through alternative providers may be obtained by some lenders in order to complete the loan application process.
				Each lender is required to provide you, the consumer, with all costs associated to be expressed as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR). This information will include the identity of the creditor, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule, and your total number of payments. Your interest rate will vary depending upon which product you select from which lender - Currently this range is usually anywhere from 0% up to 450% APR. No lenders should charge you an upfront fee. Do not agree to any terms if there is an upfront fee.
				Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. The loan renewal options will be presented to you by your lender prior to your acceptance of the loan. Please make sure to diligently read the renewal policy presented to you prior to signing the loan documents.
				</p>
				<p>
				NOTICE: PLEASE BORROW RESPONSIBLY. A SHORT TERM LOAN SHOULD BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL NEEDS ONLY, NOT AS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION. CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT DIFFICULTIES SHOULD SEEK CREDIT COUNSELING OR MEET WITH A NONPROFIT FINANCIAL COUNSELING SERVICE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. FIRST CHOICE ADVANCES ONLY REFERS YOU TO LENDERS MOST WILLING TO FUND YOUR LOAN NOT NECESSARILY THE LOWEST INTEREST RATE.
