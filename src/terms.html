				<strong>For your protection:</strong> The owner of this Website is NOT A LENDER and does not endorse or charge you for any service or product and there is no guarantee that by completing this form a loan will be provided. Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of your loan. Ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for non-payment. If you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: CHARGE YOU LATE FEES, SEND YOUR ACCOUNT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY, REPORT YOUR INFORMATION TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE OR MAY OFFER TO RENEW, EXTEND OR REFINANCE YOUR LOAN WHICH MAY CAUSE YOU TO INCURE ADDITIONAL FEES, CHARGES AND INTEREST.

				<p>
				Actual loan amounts, terms and interest rates may vary by state and by lender. This website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. This website simply matches you with an appropriate lender or lending network based on your application. Cash transfer times may vary between lenders and in some circumstances faxing is required. Typically lenders will NOT perform credit checks with the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, TransUnion. However, credit checks or consumer reports through alternative providers may be obtained by some lenders in order to complete the loan application process.
				Each lender is required to provide you, the consumer, with all costs associated to be expressed as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR). This information will include the identity of the creditor, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule, and your total number of payments. Your interest rate will vary depending upon which product you select from which lender - Currently this range is usually anywhere from 0% up to 450% APR. No lenders should charge you an upfront fee. Do not agree to any terms if there is an upfront fee.
				Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. The loan renewal options will be presented to you by your lender prior to your acceptance of the loan. Please make sure to diligently read the renewal policy presented to you prior to signing the loan documents.
				</p>
				<p>
				NOTICE: PLEASE BORROW RESPONSIBLY. A SHORT TERM LOAN SHOULD BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL NEEDS ONLY, NOT AS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION. CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT DIFFICULTIES SHOULD SEEK CREDIT COUNSELING OR MEET WITH A NONPROFIT FINANCIAL COUNSELING SERVICE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. FIRST CHOICE ADVANCES ONLY REFERS YOU TO LENDERS MOST WILLING TO FUND YOUR LOAN NOT NECESSARILY THE LOWEST INTEREST RATE.
