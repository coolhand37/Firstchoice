          <strong>For your protection:</strong> The owner of this Website is NOT A LENDER and does
          not endorse or charge you for any service or product and there is no guarantee that by
          completing this form a loan will be provided. Only your lender can provide you with
          information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of
          your loan. Ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for
          non-payment. If you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: CHARGE
          YOU LATE FEES, SEND YOUR ACCOUNT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY, REPORT YOUR INFORMATION TO A
          CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE OR MAY OFFER TO
          RENEW, EXTEND OR REFINANCE YOUR LOAN WHICH MAY CAUSE YOU TO INCURE ADDITIONAL FEES,
          CHARGES AND INTEREST.

          Actual loan amounts, terms and interest rates may vary by state and by lender. This
          website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. This website simply attempts
          to connect you with an appropriate lender or lending network based on your loan request.
          Cash transfer times may vary between lenders and in some circumstances faxing is required.
          Typically lenders will NOT perform credit checks with the three major credit reporting
          bureaus: Experian, Equifax, TransUnion. However, credit checks or consumer reports through
          alternative providers may be obtained by some lenders in order to complete the loan
          request process.<br />
          Each lender is required to provide you, the consumer, with all costs associated to be
          expressed as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR). This information will include
          the identity of the creditor, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the
          finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule, and your total number of
          payments. Your interest rate will vary depending upon which product you select from which
          lender - Currently this range is usually anywhere from 0% up to 450% APR. No lenders
          should charge you an upfront fee. Do not agree to any terms if there is an upfront fee.
          Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. The loan
          renewal options will be presented to you by your lender prior to your acceptance of the
          loan. Please make sure to diligently read the renewal policy presented to you prior to
          signing the loan documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTICE: PLEASE BORROW RESPONSIBLY. A SHORT TERM LOAN SHOULD BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM
          FINANCIAL NEEDS ONLY, NOT AS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION. CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT
          DIFFICULTIES SHOULD SEEK CREDIT COUNSELING OR MEET WITH A NONPROFIT FINANCIAL COUNSELING
          SERVICE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. FIRST CHOICE ADVANCES ONLY REFERS YOU TO LENDERS MOST WILLING
          TO FUND YOUR LOAN NOT NECESSARILY THE LOWEST INTEREST RATE.
